/*
    Write a Calculator program that will give the "Calc" prompt and
    always stay on this prompt. When a user types one of the
    following commands, the program will calculate and give the
    result.
    Typing "Exit" will exit from the Calculator program. This program
    accepts up to 50-digit numbers. Then, the division will give the
    quotient and remainder.

    Calc> 12345678967354748+9876546877687678678678678 - Addition
    Calc> 12345678995387837883748798-8738478937937498237 - Subtraction
    Calc> 123478763783847239874 * 34837472384723894732 - Multiplication
    Calc> 1233489374983933498398095/3487384 - Division
    Calc> Exit - Quit.
    Note:
    Do not accept Invalid numbers.
    Do not print leading zeros.
    Use functions and write a professional program use Linux coding style.
    Each number can be of a different digit.
    Make sure that all the Input conditions are taken care.
    Try to minimize the execution speed.
